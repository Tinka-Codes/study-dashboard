# Study Dashboard

# Weekly Planner & Priority Dashboard
Project Overview

This project is a personal weekly planner and priority dashboard, designed to help manage school tasks, coding projects, assignments, and test deadlines. The main goal is to combine time management and visual organization into a single interactive and aesthetic web page, helping the user stay on top of priorities while also tracking progress.

The design is inspired by the Holy Grail layout. The project also includes small JavaScript functionality to dynamically show countdowns for tests and assignments.

# Why I Built This

I wanted a practical, interactive tool to help manage my time effectively while balancing school, coding projects, and personal growth. I also wanted a project that would let me improve my CSS skills, learn layout structures (Flexbox), and integrate basic JavaScript.

This project is a work-in-progress and will evolve as my skills grow.
